    "> I reccomend the Euler cromer method here because it is reasonably fast at an average of 1.500132 seconds runtime for a dt of 2.5E-03 seconds for a 10 second total simulation (faster than RK4 which runs at an average of 6.263453 seconds but has a much greater accuracy for lower dt) and has (SLIGHTLLLLLLY pretty much negligibly) more accuracy than the standard Eulers method. To be honest though, there isn't much difference between the two in terms of computational speed or accuract with this sumulation. I do have one bug right now regarding repeat simulations, IE: running a F.Euler simulation, them immediatly running another simulaton causes it to reuse variables. IF you want to see the other two outputs (Euler and RK4), please change the line plot_vals_1 = F.Euler_Cromer(check_val=True) to plot_vals_1 = F.Euler(check_val=True) or plot_vals_1 = F.RK4(check_val=True) and then rerun the whole notebook. Other than this glitch the progam works.\n",
