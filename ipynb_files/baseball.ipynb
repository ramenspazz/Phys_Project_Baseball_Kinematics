    "Looking up some numbers on wikipedia, the average MLB fastball is pitched at approximatly 41 meters per second. I chose a dt such that there will be on the order of a few centimeters of movement or less at pitched speed per simulation timeslice. This happens to work out to just about 250microseconds with rounding and gives nice numbers to work for the simulation. After testing however, 2.5E-03 seconds was a reasonable choice with little if any noticible loss in accuracy and brings down the computation time by a whole order of magnitude. "

    "> I reccomend the Euler cromer method here because it is reasonably fast at an average of 1.500132 seconds runtime for a dt of 2.5E-03 seconds for a 10 second total simulation (faster than RK4 which runs at an average of 6.263453 seconds but has a much greater accuracy for lower dt) and has (SLIGHTLLLLLLY pretty much negligibly) more accuracy than the standard Eulers method. To be honest though, there isn't much difference between the two in terms of computational speed or accuract with this sumulation. F.sim_and_plot(arg) is the plotting function and takes an integer 1, 2 or 3. 1 corresponds to Euler, 2 to Euler-Cromer, 3 to Runge Kutta 4."
